Next.js is a powerful framework for building React applications. In this post, I'll share my experience learning Next.js and why I think it's a great choice for web development.

## Why Next.js?

- Server-side rendering
- Easy routing
- API routes
- Great developer experience

I'm looking forward to building more projects with Next.js!
